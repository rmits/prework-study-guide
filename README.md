## Description

This study guide was created in order to assist new students, like myself, coming into the Coding Bootcamp Program. It provides the basics of some of the topics that will be covered in the program so that some students don't feel overwhelmed stepping into a new field without any knowledge at all. As being one of those students, this was an amazing, yet frustrating at times, exercise that I hope will aide fellow bootcampers into warming up for the modules of the program.

This site has some starter notes for the topics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Using JavaScript, I created Console Logs including these topics, and a randomizer that chooses one of these topics for you to start just incase you don't know where to jump in!
